## Installation

1. Make sure that your OpenRCT2 version is up-to-date. You need at least version `0.4.5` or a recent development version.
2. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Sadret/openrct2-rctris/releases) page and download the `openrct2-rctris-1.0.0.js` file from the latest release. Save it in the `plugin` subfolder of your OpenRCT2 user directory.\
On Windows, this is usually at `C:Users\{User}\Documents\OpenRCT2\plugin`.
3. Start OpenRCT2 and open a scenario. The plug-in can be found in the map menu in the upper toolbar of OpenRCT2.

## Gameplay

Fill the game arena with blocks.
Completely filled lines disappear and increase the score.
More difficult moves and line clears reward more points.
More details can be found for example on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris).
